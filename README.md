# Autonomous-Car-with-Processing-IDE

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

This project focuses on the development of an autonomous car system using embedded systems and the Processing IDE. It integrates various sensors (e.g., radar, temperature, voltage) with microcontrollers (such as ESP32 and NodeMCU), and likely visualizes or controls the system using the Processing IDE.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Embedded Firmware

1. Open Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
2. Load the code from `main_esp32`, `nodemcu_code`, or `final_code`.
3. Select the correct board and COM port.
4. Compile and upload the code.

```bash
# For PlatformIO (example)
platformio run -t upload -e esp32dev
```

### Visualization

1. Launch Processing IDE.
2. Open `sketch_360_radar` or other sketches.
3. Run the sketch to see sensor data or radar visualization.
